# hello-world
Hello, Jacob Cruze here.  Just getting my repositories set up for future use as I learn web development.
It's my goal to land a junior dev job by the end of the year.  
For now I'm just here to be a sponge.  Frankly I'm not entirely sure what a repository actually IS right now
Update 3/23: I know what a repository is now.  I've been working on HTML the past few weeks.  Feeling pretty good about it.  Starting CSS this week.
